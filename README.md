Includes:

 HOMEPAGE,

 List View (1st page):

 • Provide a button to navigate to the detailed view for each event.

 Detail View (2nd page):
 • Show all details of a selected event, including nested information.

 Edit Form event:
 • Create a React component for editing existing car records.
 • Include controlled components for all relevant fields, considering nested structures.
 • Implement validation to ensure data integrity.
 • Provide a "Submit" button to update the record.
 • Allow users to cancel and return to the detail view.

 Create Form event:

 • Redux toolkit as a state manager.
 • React-hook-form for forms.
 • SCSS modules for styling, application is responsive.
 • For backend purposes I used firebase
